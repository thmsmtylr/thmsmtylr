## Hi, Iâ€™m @thmsmtylr ðŸ‘‹
Tech Lead with 10+ years of experience currently working for [A&S Labels](https://www.linkedin.com/company/a-s-labels-pty-ltd/mycompany/). I specializes in *Front-end/UI/Design System development*. I am comfortable working with a wide range of languages and architectures, such as TypeScript, JavaScript, Elixir, Golang, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Serverless, Headless, Monolithic, etc. I have worked with both early-stage startups and large corporations, and I am passionate about delivering high-quality software solutions that meet the unique needs of each business. My ability to communicate complex technical concepts in a clear and concise way allows me to collaborate effectively with non-technical stakeholders and deliver results efficiently.
  
ðŸš§ In my free time, I'm developing a serverless e-commerce SaaS that enables vendors to manage multiple brands, regions, currencies, and tax regulations (including DDP and DDU), along with many other features currently in development. <br />
